   <p>Chaungtha is renowned for its fresh and reasonably priced seafood. A major attraction is a small pagoda built on a limestone boulder at the southern end of the beach. The main beach is more scrappy and down-to-earth. Nearby fishing villages and tidal mangrove forests are also popular among the tourists.

Chaungtha has several offshore islands, available for snorkelling and is accessible from nearby Ngwesaung beach along a coastal motorbike trail.</p>
